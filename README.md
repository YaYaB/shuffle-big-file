# Shuffle big file
> Simply shuffle a big file that does not fit in memory


This tool helps you shuffle by line a big file that does not fit in memory.
Given the *batch_size* that your machine can put in memory it will shuffle the whole file by
reading as many times as necessary.

## Installation

OS X, Linux & Windows:
No specific requirements except python3 (3.4 and later).

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/YaYaB/shuffle-big-file
```


## Usage example

```sh
usage: Shuffle a huge file without loading in fully in RAM [-h]
                                                           [--input_file INPUT_FILE]
                                                           [--batch_size BATCH_SIZE]
                                                           [--output_file OUTPUT_FILE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --input_file INPUT_FILE
                        Path to input file
  --batch_size BATCH_SIZE
                        Batch size that can fit in memory
  --output_file OUTPUT_FILE
                        Path to output shuffled file
